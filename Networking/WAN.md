A WAN is a network infrastructure that spans a wide geographical area. WANs are typically managed by service providers (SPs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
WANs have specific characteristics:
- WANs interconnect [[LAN]]s over wide geographical areas such as between cities, states, provinces, countries, or continents.
- WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.
- WANs typically provide slower speed links between LANs.

Unlike LANs, which are typically confined to a single location like a building or campus, WANs facilitate communication and data exchange over greater distances, potentially across cities, countries, or even continents. WANs use various technologies to connect distant networks and enable the transmission of data between geographically separated locations. 

Key characteristics of WANs include: 
- **Geographic Extent:** WANs cover vast geographical areas, allowing organizations to connect networks that are located apart. This enables communication and resource sharing between locations that could be situated in different cities, states, or countries.
- **Public and Private Networks:** WANs can be built using both public and private infrastructure. Private WANs are often constructed using leased lines, dedicated connections, or virtual private networks ([[VPN]]s). Public WANs may utilize the internet or other shared networks to connect remote locations.
- **Lower Data Transfer Rates Compared to LANs:** While WANs enable communication over long distances, data transfer rates are generally lower than those achievable within a LAN. The performance of a WAN can be influenced by factors such as the distance between locations, the quality of network connections, and available bandwidth.
- **Variety of Technologies:** WANs employ a variety of technologies for communications, including dedicated leased lines, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), VPNs, and the internet. Each technology has its advantages and is chosen based on factors such as cost, reliability, and bandwidth requirements.
- **High-Level Protocols:** WANs use high-level networking protocols to facilitate communication between devices across different networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) is a fundamental protocol used for routing and addressing data across WANs.
- **Managed by Service Providers:** Many organizations choose to use services provided by telecommunications companies or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to establish and manage their WAN connections. These providers offer connectivity solutions and manage the infrastructure required for WAN communications.
- **Interconnected LANs:** WANs enable the connection of multiple LANs, allowing organizations with offices in different locations to share resources, collaborate, and access centralized services.
