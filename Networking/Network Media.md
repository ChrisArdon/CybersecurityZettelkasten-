Communication transmits across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices.
- **Metal wires within cables:** Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
- **Glass or plastic within cables (fiber-optic cable):** Data is encoded into pulses of light. 
- **Wireless transmission:** Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves. 

The four main criteria for choosing network media are these: 
- What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
- What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
- What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
- What is the cost of the media and installation?

The choice of network media is a crucial aspect of network design and impacts the performance, reliability, and speed of data transmission. There are several types of network media, and they can be broadly categorized into two main groups: guided media and unguided media. 

### Guided Media
- **Twisted Pair Cable:** Consists of pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together. It is a commonly used in [[Ethernet]] networks. 
- **Coaxial Cable:** Uses a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer. Coaxial cables were commonly used in older Ethernet networks. 
- **Fiber Optic Cable:** Transmits data using light signals through glass or plastic fibers. Fiber optic cables provide high bandwidth and are immune to electromagnetic interference. 

### Unguided Media (Wireless)
- **Radio Waves:** Wireless communication using radio frequency signals, commonly used in Wi-Fi networks. 
- **Microwave:** Utilizes microwaves frequencies for point-to-point communications, often used in long-distance and high-capacity communications links. 
- **Infrared Waves:** Uses infrared light for short-range communication, often seen in remote controls or shot-distance wireless data transfer.
