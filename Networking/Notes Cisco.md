All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can be called end devices. 

In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.

Communication transmits across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.
