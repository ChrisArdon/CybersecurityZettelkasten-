Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. In small business and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) refers to a decentralized architecture where participants (peers) share resources, services, or information directly with each other without the need for a central server or authority. In a p2p network, each participant has equal status and can act both as a client and a server, sharing resources and contributing to the overall network functionality. 

Key characteristics of p2p networks include: 

- **Decentralization:** Unlike client-server models where a central server manages and controls resources, P2P networks distribute tasks and responsibilities among all participants peers. There is no single point of control or failure. 
- **Equal Status:** All peers in a p2p network have equal capabilities and can initiate communications or share resources with other peers. There is no hierarchy or distinction between clients and servers. 
- **Resource Sharing:** Participants in a p2p network share various resources, such as files, processing power, or bandwidth, directly with one another. This sharing is often done without the need for intermediaries. 
- **Scalability:** P2P networks can be easily scalable because adding new peers to the network does not requires significant changes to the overall architecture. Each new peer contributes to the network's resources and capabilities. 
- **Redundancy:** Due to the decentralized nature of the p2p networks, they can be more robust in the face of failures. If one peer ([[Hosts]]) becomes unavailable, others can still communicate and share resources. 

P2P networks are commonly associated with file sharing applications, where users can share files directly with each other without relying on a central server. Examples of p2p file-sharing protocols include BitTorrent.
