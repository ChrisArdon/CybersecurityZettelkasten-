The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetworks, or internet for short).
Some of the [[LAN]]s are connected to each other through a [[WAN]] connection. WANs are then connected to each other. WANs can connect through copper wires, fiber-optic cables, and wireless transmissions ([[Network Media]]).
The internet is not owned by any individual or group. Ensuring effective communication across this diverse infrastructure requires the application of consistent and commonly recognized technologies and standards as well as the cooperation of many network administration agencies. There are organizations that were developed to help maintain the structure and standardization of internet protocols and processes. These organizations include the Internet **Engineering Task Force** ([[IETF]]), **Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ([[ICAAN]])**, and the **Internet Architecture Board ([[IAB]])**, plus many others.  


### What is the Internet?
#chatGPT 
The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that use a standardized communication protocol suite called the Internet Protocol Suite ([[TCP/IP]]). It is a vast and decentralized network that connect millions of private, public, academic, business, and government worldwide. 

Key features of the Internet include: 
- **Global Connectivity:** The Internet connects millions of networks and billions of devices ([[Hosts]]) worldwide, allowing users to access information and communicate with each other regardless of geographical location. 
- **Decentralization:** The Internet operates in a decentralized manner, meaning there is no central government authority or single point of control. It is a distributed network where information is routed through multiple paths, enhancing robustness and resilience. 
- **Protocols:** The Internet relies on standardized communication protocols, primarily the Internet Protocol ([[IP Address]]) for addressing and routing, and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for reliable data transmission. These protocols form the basis of the TCP/IP suite. 
- **Web and Browsing:** The World Wide Web ([[WWW]]) is a major component of the Internet, allowing users to access and share multimedia content, websites, and interactive applications. Web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, enable users to navigate and interact with web content. 
- **Email and Communication:** Email (Electronic Mail), is a widely used communication tool on the Internet. It enables users to send and receive messages electronically. Additionally, various communication platforms, including instant messaging, voice over IP ([[VoIP]]), and social media, facilitate real-time interaction. 
- **File Sharing:** The Internet allows users to share files and resources through protocols like File Transfer Protocol ([[FTP]]), and [[Peer-to-Peer]] (P2P) networks. Cloud storage services also enable users to store and access files over the internet. 
- **Search Engines:** Search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, help users find information on the Internet by indexing and organizing vast amounts of content available on the web. 
- **Social Networking:** Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, provide a means for users to connect, share content, and communicate with others globally. 

### The development and emergence of the Internet
The emergence of the Internet can be traced back to several key milestones and contributions over the decades. The evolution of the internet is a complex and collaborative process involving various technological advancements, research projects, and the contributions of many individuals. 

1. **1950s - 1960s: Precursors and Early Concepts:** 
	- The idea of a global network of computers was envisioned by computer scientists and researchers. Early concepts and precursors included J.C.R. Licklider's vision of an "Intergalactic Computer Network" and the concept of time-sharing.
2. **1969: ARPANET - The Birth of the Internet:** 
	- The ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) is considered the first practical implementation of the internet. It was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency).
	- The first message was sent over ARPANET on October 29, 1969, between computers at the same University of California. Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
3. **1979s: TCP/IP Protocols:** 
	- The development of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn in the 1970s laid the foundation for the standardized communication protocols that form the basis of the Internet (TCP/IP).
4. **1980s: Expansion and Commercialization:** 
	- The TCP/IP protocols were adopted as the standard for ARPANET in 1983, marking a significant step in the development of the Internet.
	- The National Science Foundation (NSF) established the NSFNET, a high-speed backbone network, in 1986. This expansion increased the Internet's reach and connectivity.
	- The Domain Name System ([[DNS]]) was introduced in the 1980s to provide human-readable addresses for computers on the network.
5. **1990s: World Wide Web ([[WWW]]) and Global Growth:** 
	- Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN. The first website went live in 1991, and the WWW became a user-friendly interface for accessing information on the internet. 
	- The Internet gained widespread popularity and started to become accessible to the general public. Commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) emerged, providing dial-up and broadband access to households. 
	- The development of graphical browsers, such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, made the web more accessible and user-friendly.
