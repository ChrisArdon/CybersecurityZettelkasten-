There are two other terms which are similar to the term internet: intranet and extranet. 

Intranet is a term often used to refer to private connection of [LAN](LAN)s and [[WAN]]s that belongs to an organization. An intranet is designed to be accessible only by the organization's members, employees, or others with authorization.
An organization may use an extranet to provide secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization but require access to the organization's data. Here are some examples of extranets:
- A company that is providing access to outside suppliers and contractors. 
- A hospital that is providing booking system to doctors so they can make appointments for their patients. 
- A local office of education that is providing budget and personnel information to the schools in its district.

## What is an Intranet?

An intranet is a private [[network]] within an organization that uses internet technologies to securely share information, collaborate on projects, and provide internal services. Intranets utilize the same technologies and protocols as the global Internet, such as web browsers and TCP/IP, but are isolated from the public internet by security measure ([[Security Mechanisms]]) like [[firewalls]]. 

Key characteristics of intranets include: 
1. **Private [[Network]]:** An intranet is a closed [[network]] that is accessible only to individuals within a specific organization. It is not open to the public, and access it typically restricted through authentication mechanisms like usernames and passwords. 
2. **Information Sharing:** Intranets provide a platform for organizations to share information internally. This includes documents, announcements, policies, and other resources that employees may need in the course of their work. 
3. **Collaboration Tools:** Intranets often incorporate collaboration tools such as document sharing, wikis, discussion forums, and project management systems. These tools facilitate teamwork and communication among employees. 
4. **Internal Communication:** Intranets serve as a central hub for internet communication. Organizations use intranets to disseminate news, updates, and important announcements to employees. Internal messaging systems may also be integrated. 
5. **Employee Portals:** Many intranets include employee portals that provide personalized access to individualized information, such as employee profiles, and HR-related documents. 
6. **Security Measures:** Due to the sensitive nature of the information shared on intranets, security is a critical aspect. Intranets are protected by [[firewalls]], encryption, and access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals can access and interact with the networks. 
7. **Integration with External Systems:** While intranets are internal networks, they may be integrated with external systems, such as cloud services or external databases, to enhance functionality and provide a seamless user experience. 

### How the intranets are related to networking?
Intranets are closely related to networking as they are a type of private [[network]] designed for internal use within an organization. 
1. **Communication Infrastructure:** Intranets rely on networking technologies to facilitate communication and data exchange within an organization. These technologies include [[network]] protocols, such as TCP/IP, that enable the transfer of data between computers and devices to the intranet. 
2. **Connectivity:** Intranet connect multiple devices ([[hosts]]), such as computers, servers, and other networked devices, within the organization. The networking infrastructure, whether wired or wireless, allows these devices to communicate and share information seamlessly. 
3. **Data Transmission:** Networking protocols and technologies govern the transmission of data within intranets. Whether through wired connections (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless connections (e.g., Wi-Fi), the network infrastructure ensures the reliable and efficient transfer of data. 
4. **Security and Access Controls:** Networking plays a crucial role in securing intranets. Firewalls, encryption, and access control mechanisms are implemented at the network level to safeguard the intranet from unauthorized access and potential external threats. 
5. **IP Addressing:** Intranets use IP addressing to uniquely identify devices within the network. Each device connected to the intranet is assigned and IP address, allowing for proper routing and communication. 
6. **Internet Connectivity:** While intranets are private networks, they may have connections to the internet for specific purposes. The networking infrastructure manages the integration of the internet with external networks, providing access to the internet while maintaining security measures. 

## What is an Extranet?

An extranet is a controlled private network that extends beyond an organization's internal network to include external users, such as customers, suppliers, partners, or other authorized third parties. It allows organizations to share specific information, collaborate on projects, and conduct business transactions with external entities in a secure and controlled manner. Essentially, an extranet provides a secure and restricted pathway for authorized external users to access certain parts of an organization's internal network. 
Key features of extranets include:
- **Restricted Access:** Extranets provide controlled access to specific external users who have been granted permission. Authentication mechanisms, such as username and passwords, are commonly used to ensure only authorized individuals can access the extranet. 
- **Secure Communication:** Security measures, such as encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols, are employed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the extranet. 
- **User Roles and Permission:** Extranets often have features that allow organizations to define user roles and permissions, determining the level of access granted to different external users. This helps maintain control over the information and resources shared. 

Extranets are used across various industries to facilitate collaboration, information sharing, and business transactions with external partners. Here are some examples of organizations or scenarios where extranets are commonly employed:

- **Manufacturing and Supply Chain:** A manufacturing company may use an extranet to collaborate with suppliers for inventory management, order processing, and production planning. Suppliers can access specific information related to their products and orders. 
- **Financial Services:** Banks or financial institution may utilize extranets to provide secure access to financial data for corporate clients, allowing businesses to view account information, conduct transactions, and access financial reports. 
- **Education Institutions:** Universities and educational institutions may implement extranets to provide secure access to course materials, grades, and collaborative spaces for students, faculty, and external researchers.
