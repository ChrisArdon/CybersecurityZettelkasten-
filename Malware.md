# What is Malware?
Malware, short for "malicious software", refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called "hackers") to steal [[data]] and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Example of common malware include [[Viruses]], [[Worms]], [[Trojan Viruses]], [[Spyware]], [[Adware]], and [[Ransomware]]. Recent malware attacks have exfiltrated data in mass amounts. 
- Cualquier software que causa daño o vulnera la seguridad a través de infiltrarse en una computadora o red pueden considerarse malware. 
- Incluidos virus, caballos de Troya, gusanos, rootkits, scareware, ransomware, y spyware.
- Normalmente es una variedad de software hostil que de forma intencionada pueden recopilar información confidencial, dañar, alterar o provocar fallas graves en los sistemas informáticos.

# How do I protect my [[Network]] against malware?
Typically, business focus on preventative tools to stop breaches. By securing the perimeter, business assume they are safe. Some advance malware, however, will eventually make their way into your network. As a result, it is crucial to deploy technologies that continually monitor and detect malware that has evaded perimeter defenses. Sufficient advance [[malware protection]] requires multiple layers of safeguards along with high-level network visibility and intelligence. 


# How do I detect and respond to malware?
***Malware will inevitably penetrate your network.*** You must have defenses that provide significant visibility and breach detection. In order to remove malware, you must be able to identify malicious actors quickly. This requires constant network scanning. Once the [[Threat]] is identified, you must remove the malware from your network. Today's [[Antivirus]] products are not enough to protect against advanced cyber threats. 

# Malware examples
#chatGPT
1. **WannaCry:** This malware, also known as WannaCrypt, WanaCrypt0r, and WCry, is a ransomware strain that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the descryption key. It was first discovered in May 2017 and quickly spread across the globe, infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries.
2. **Stuxnet:** This highly sophisticated was specifically designed to attack industrial control systems, such as those used in nuclear facilites. It was first discovered in 2010 and is believed to have been developed by de US and Israeli governments as a weapon to attack Iran's nuclear power. 
3. **NotPetya:** This malware, also known as Petya, Petrwrap, and SortaPetya, is a strain of ransomware that was first discovered in 2016. It spreads quickly through networks and is known for its ability to cause significant damage. 
4. **Mirai:** This malware is a type of botnet that is typically used to lauch distributed denial-of-service ([[DDoS]]) attacks. It was first discovered in 2016 and is known for its ability to infect and take control of large numbers of [[Internet of Things (IoT)]] devices, such as smart cameras and home routers. 
5. **Trickbot:** This malware is a type of banking Trojan that is used to steal sensitive information from victims, such as login credentials and financial data. It is frequently used in conjunction with other malware, such as ransomware, to maximize the damage inflicted on victims. It was first discovered in 2016 and it continues to evolve and spread. 


# How is a malware created?
#chatGPT 
Malware is created by [[Hackers]] and [cybercriminals](Cybercrime) who want to gain [unauthorized access](Confidentiality) to computer systems or steal sensitive information. There are many ways that malware can be created, but some common methods include the following:
- Writing code from scratch: Some malware is created by writing the code from scratch, using programming languages ass C++, or [[Python]]. This allows the hacker to customize the malware to their specific needs and make it as effective as possible.
- Modifying existing code: In some cases, hackers will take existing code, such as [[open-source software]], and modify it to include malicious functionality. This can be quicker and easier that writing code from scratch, but the malware may not be as effective. 
- Using malware creation tools: There are various tools and programs available that make it easier for hackers to create malware. These tools often have user-friendly interfaces and allows the hacker to customize the malware without needing to have advanced coding skills.
- Leveraging vulnerabilities in software: Many types of malware are created by exploiting vulnerabilities in software programs. For example, a hacker might find a weakness in a web browser and create malware that targets that weakness to gain access to a victim's computer. 

In general, the goal of creating malware is to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, steal sensitive information, or cause damage to the system. The specific method used to create the malware will depend on the goals of the hacker and their level of skill.


# Example of a malware code
#chatGPT #example 
Here is an example of a simple malware code that might be used to gain unauthorized access to a computer system:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
  char username[100];
  char password[100];

  printf("Enter username: ");
  scanf("%s", username);

  printf("Enter password: ");
  scanf("%s", password);

  if (strcmp(username, "admin") == 0 && strcmp(password, "password") == 0)
  {
    printf("Access granted\n");
    // Code to perform malicious actions goes here
  }
  else
  {
    printf("Access denied\n");
  }

  return 0;
}

```
This code prompts the user to enter a username and password, and then checks to see if the entered values are "admin" and "password". It they are, it grants the user access and executes the code that performs the malicious actions. If the entered values are incorrect, it denies access. 
Of course this is just a very simple example, and real-world malware is typically much more complex and sophisticated. It is also important to note that simply looking at code like this will not necessarily reveal its true purpose or intent. Malware authors often use various techniques to obscure their code and make it difficult to detect. 


## The first known malware created
The first known malware was a computer virus called "Creeper", which was created in the early 1970s. It was designed to infect DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system. Creeper was not malicious in the sense that it was designed to cause harm to computer systems, but it was the first known instance of a self-replicating program that spread from one computer to another. 
Creeper was created by a programmer name Bob Thomas as an experiment in self-replication. It would display the message **"I'M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN"** on the infected computer's terminal, and then copy itself to other computers on the network. It was eventually stopped by another program called "Reaper", which was designed to hunt down and delete instances of Creeper. 
While Creeper was not malicious in intent, it paved the way for the development of more malicious malware that followed. Today, malware encompasses a wide range of malicious software, including viruses, worms, ransomware, and many others. 


# Malware Policies
Here are some examples of [malware policies](Cybersecurity Policies):
1. Install and regularly update antivirus software on all computers and devices.
2. Set up firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to your network. 
3. Create strong, unique passwords for all accounts and regularly update them.
4. Educate employees on how to identify and avoid phishing attempts.
5. Establish protocols for reporting suspicious emails or websites.
6. Regularly back up important data to prevent loss in case of a ransomware attack.

These are jus a few examples, but the specific policies  a company or organization chooses to implement will depend on their specific needs and risks. It's important to regularly review and update your malware policies to ensure they are effective in protecting against the latest threats.
