Phishing (pronounced: *fishing*) is an attack that attempts to steal your money, or your identity, by getting you to reveal personal information --such as credit card numbers, bank information, or passwords-- on websites that pretend to be legitimate. [[Cybercriminals]] typically pretend to be reputable companies, friends, or acquaintances in a fake message, which contains a link to a phishing website. 

# Learn to spot a phishing message

Phishing is a popular form of cybercrime because of how effective it is. Cybercriminals have been successful using emails, text messages, direct messages on social media or in videogames, to get people to respond with their personal information. **The best defense is awareness and knowing what to look for**.
