# Confidentiality

### Confidentiality protects secrets 
Confidentiality is one of the core concepts of cybersecurity.  Simply put, confidentiality ensures that **[[secret information]] is protected from unauthorized disclosure**.
Protecting confidentiality is a responsibility shared between technologists and everyone else in the organization. Clearly, cybersecurity professionals and other IT staff **bear the burden of ensuring that confidentiality controls are in place and functioning properly**. However, it's important to remember that everyone with access to sensitive information has a role to play in preserving the confidentiality of that [[data]].
