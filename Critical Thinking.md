## Beyond Technology: Critical Thinking in [[Cybersecurity]]

Often when we think of cybersecurity, our immediate thought is it's a very technical field. We think automatically. 
- ...the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement. - **Wikipedia**

## Why in Cybersecurity?

- Cybersecurity is a diverse, multifaced field 
	- Constantly changing environment 
	- Fast-paced
	- Multiple stakeholders, whether that comes from a variety of backgrounds, whether that's economic, legal, HR and so on.
	- Adversary presence
- Critical thinking forces us to think and act in situations where there are no clear answers nor specific procedures
- Part Art, Part science: This is subjective and impossible to measure 


## "Google it"

- We live in an era when information is widely available
- The default response to questions is '*Google it*' rather than brainstorming
	- Sharp contrast from when books were the main source of information
- This wealth of information can overwhelm our reasoning abilities 
	- More data != more knowledge


# The Elevator Problem 
#example 
## Situation
You are the owner of an office building. Your tenants are complaining that the elevator is too old, slow, and the have to wait forever.
The will break their leases if you don't fix the problem. 

### What Would You Do?
- Replace the lift
- Install a stronger motor
- Upgrade de lift algorithm
- Tell them to take the stairs
- Install "express elevators"
- Sheave regrooving 
- Nothing
- ?
Solution: **Install Mirrors**
The problem framing was that **Waiting is boring**. So rather than making the elevator faster, the solution space is transferred into shorten the perceived wait time. That can be done a lot more simply and cheaply by putting up mirrors, playing music, installing art displays, things like that. 

# 5 Key Skill
*Learn to assess hard problems and anticipate the unexpected*

**Challenge Assumptions**
- Systematically list and challenge
- Refine as you learn more
**Consider Alternatives**
- Brainstorm full range of possibilities
- Break into components - who/what/when/where/why/how?
**Evaluate data**
- Crux of the scientific method
- Does the data fit your hypothesis?
**Identify Key Drivers**
- What are the driving forces at play?
- This can help you identify the future
**Understand Context**
- MOST IMPORTANT!
- Put yourself in others' shoes - reframe the problem

### Skill #1: Challenge Your Assumptions
- An **assumption** is a thought that causes us to predict an outcome
- Usually based on a past experience or old thoughts and evidence.
- **Challenge them!** Systematically list your assumptions and then assess whether it is solid, has caveats, or is unsupported.
- Refine as you learn more and circumstances change.
- Questions are converted into collection requirements (I need more hard data) or research topics (I need more information).

### Skill #2: Consider Alternative Explanations
- Our brains can piece together a situation with just a few bits of data.
- Failure to consider missing data or alternatives can lead us down the wrong path.
- Avoid yourself become entrenched in one explanation.

**Brainstorm**
- Get crazy, get more people in the room
- List all the possibilities
- Go from negative to positive
**The 6 W's**
- Provide framework
- Who/what/when/where/why/how
- Evaluate all dimensions
**Null Hypothesis**
- Establish the opposite of your main hypothesis
- Useful for anomalous data.


### Skill #3: Evaluate Data
- **Know. Your. Data.**
	- What does normal look like?
	- Key to anomaly detection
- ***Establish a baseline for what's normal***
	- Web traffic
	- Network sensors
	- Endpoint activity
	- Source/destination
	- Volumen/velocity
- **Be on the lookout for _inconsistent data_**


### Skill #4: Identify Key Drivers
Key drivers are things that can significantly impact a situation, and they're not always technical in nature.

[[Technology]]
- Encryption
- Authentication
- Tools/frameworks
- Infrastructure availability
[[Regulatory]]
- Privacy
- Intellectual Property
- Safety Regulations
- GDPR/HIPAA/etc.
[[Society]]
- Politics
- Public perception
- Expectation to keep data secure
[[Supply Chain]]
- Customer requirements
- Logistics 
- Cost
- Scheduling
[[Employees]]
- Employee perspective
- Skills
- Training needs
[[Threat Actors]]
- Technical capability
- Motives
- Opportunity


### Skill #5: Understand the Context
Context is the operational environment in which you are working, and so the context is different with the context at a university, which is different than a context at Microsoft, or another company.
- Context means you understand the operational environment in which you are working.
- Consider the **perspective** of your managers, colleagues, and clients
- *What do they need from me? How can I frame the issue? Do I need to place the questions in a broader context?*
- **Framing techniques** help keep everyone on the same page.
