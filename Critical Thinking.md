## Beyond Technology: Critical Thinking in [[Cybersecurity]]

Often when we think of cybersecurity, our immediate thought is it's a very technical field. We think automatically. 
- ...the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgement. - **Wikipedia**

## Why in Cybersecurity?

- Cybersecurity is a diverse, multifaced field 
	- Constantly changing environment 
	- Fast-paced
	- Multiple stakeholders, whether that comes from a variety of backgrounds, whether that's economic, legal, HR and so on.
	- Adversary presence
- Critical thinking forces us to think and act in situations where there are no clear answers nor specific procedures
- Part Art, Part science: This is subjective and impossible to measure 


## "Google it"

- We live in an era when information is widely available
- The default response to questions is '*Google it*' rather than brainstorming
	- Sharp contrast from when books were the main source of information
- This wealth of information can overwhelm our reasoning abilities 
	- More data != more knowledge
