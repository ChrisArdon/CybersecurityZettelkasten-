# What is Security Attack?


## Attack Classification

### Passive Attacks
- Essentially eavesdropping styles of attack
- Second class is traffic analysis

**_Do you think passive attacks are hard or easy to detect?_**
Well, they hard to detect because the message from Bob to Alice meets our security criteria. The messages are authenticated, so Alice can prove that the message is in fact back from Bob. The message can be passed an integrity check because Darth our interceptor is only collecting the messages not changing them. 

### Active Attacks
- Explicit interception and modification
- Several classes of these attacks exist
