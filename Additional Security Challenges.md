# Computer Security Challenges

[[Cybersecurity]] not as simple as it seems
- Easy requirements, tough solutions

Solutions can be attacked themselves
- Security policy enforcement structures as the targets 

Protection of enforcement structure can complicate solutions. 
- Solution itself can be easy, but complicated by protection

Security Architectural decisions
- Know what to do, but where to do them?

The top point about security architecture is requiring constan effort speaks to the dynamic nature of our task, that the adversaries are constantly introducing new attack profiles, new vulnerabilities are released from software manufacturers that turned into exploits, just the war changes and it changes every week. So constantly, our [[defense mechanisms]], our security architectures also need to be very mobile, very agile to adapt and to change to the changing attacks. Otherwise, we will be very much like we go back in the 1990s with static, castle, moat drawbridge type of security architectures.
